        <p>This initiative includes a GitHub repository, which includes more information as well as a Wiki page and Kanban project schedule. Lacey Chabert is widely regarded as the "queen" of Hallmark movies, having starred in over 30 Hallmark original romantic comedies, dramas, and mysteries. Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a meme that cast him as "center of the universe" in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Based on how many movies he's starred and costarred in with top actors and actresses in Hollywood, analysts joked that nobody in Hollywood was more than six degrees of separation from Kevin. And they backed it up with research and analyis. Other studies have proven several people are more likely candidates as the center of the Hollywood metaverse.</p>
        <p>This neophyte Python program performs similar analysis on Lacey Chabert within Hallmark movies. This initiative is associated with a Code Louisville bootcamp on Python programming and data analysis. It uses a public dataset provided by IMDB, and provides a command-line program that provides the capability to query the database to learn more about an actor or actress or the movies they've costarred in.</p>
        <p>This program also includes SQL functions using SQLite3, using the same data. A few graphs prototyped in Jupyter Notebook will also be displayed.</p>
