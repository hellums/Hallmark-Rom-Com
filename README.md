# INITIATIVE OVERVIEW
This repo is a work in progress (not complete). It contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory bootcamp course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

# INITIATIVE GOALS
This repo and project will have several purposes:
- Satisfy the 4+ minimum requirements of the bootcamp assignment in the syllabus
- Satisfy as many optional requirements as possible

### INITIATIVE SCOPE
Is Lacey Chabert indeed the "Center of the (Hallmark) Universe," as Kevin Bacon reputably is to Hollywood? Given the time and resource limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or full programming approach to the _"6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"_ topic itself (using BFS or Breadth-First Search algorithms, for example). It merely provides a working environment to support the programming and data science portions of the course, using a subset of movies and actors specific to Hallmark original movies, romantic comedies, mysteries, and dramas.

# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
TO RUN (ON MAC):

python3 romcom.py

TO UNIT TEST (ON MAC):

python3 -m unittest test_romcom -v
(or python3 -m unittest discover -v)

ON WINDOWS:

use whichever command launches python 3 (for example, py3 romcom.py, py3 -m unittest test_romcom)

# PACKAGES INVOLVED
See requirements.txt file in project folder.

# FEATURES PLANNED AT INITIATIVE OUTSET (CHECK = SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION)

- [x] Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
- [x] Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code.
- [X] Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- [x] Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.

Category 2: Utilize External Data:
- [x] Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.
- [x] Connect to a database and read data using SQL.

Category 3: Data Display
- [X] Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

Category 4: Best Practices
- [ ] The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
- [x] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.

"Stretch" list:

- [ ] Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
- [X] Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
