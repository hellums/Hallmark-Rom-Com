# OVERVIEW
This repo contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

# METHODOLOGY
The last two years have been very tumultuous for the "United" States, whose citizens are more divided than ever. There is plentiful statistical data available publicly from private, state, federal, and international sources regarding different aspects of state demographics based on multiple categories and attributes, such as geographical location, manufacturer, import/export, political affiliation, socio-economic status, ethnicity, education, family size, gun ownership, violence, riot participation, news sources, social media usage, etc. The goal will be to prepare, visualize, and analyze as many available sources of data as possible in order to hypothesize and test possible correlations and summarize key conclusions about one or more key categorizations (TBD).

### PROJECT SCOPE
Given the time and resource limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or representative study of the topic itself, but merely to provide a working environment to support the proogramming and data science portions of the course. It could also be used as a source of information to support additional avenues of research in this subject area.
