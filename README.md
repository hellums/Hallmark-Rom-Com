# OVERVIEW
Is Lacey Chabert indeed the "Center of the (Hallmark) Universe," as Kevin Bacon reputably is to Hollywood? This project addresses that proposition, using a [subset of IMDB listed movies](https://github.com/hellums/lacey-bacon/blob/root/watchlist.txt) and actors from Hallmark original movies, romantic comedies, mysteries, and dramas.  

All images and websites shown here belong to the original copyright holders and are used for academic and demonstration purposes only. Source and derived data is [publicly available and courtesy of IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).
