# OVERVIEW
This repo contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

# METHODOLOGY
There is plentiful statistical data available publicly from private, state, federal, and international sources regarding different aspects of state demographics and gun sales and ownership in those states based on multiple categories and attributes, such as geographical location, manufacturer, import/export, political affiliation, socio-economic status, ethnicity, education, family size, type of weapons, etc. The goal will be to prepare, visualize, and analyze as many available sources of data as possible in order to hypothesize and test possible correlations and summarize key conclusions.

### PROJECT SCOPE
Given the time limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or representative study of the topic itself, but merely to provide a working environment to support the proogramming and data science portions of the course. It could also be used as a source of information to support additional avenues of research in this subject area.

### TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- GitHub
- Slack
- Python
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda
- Cookiecutter (high level)
- HTML, Javascript, CSS (high level, "big picture")
