# OVERVIEW
This repo contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory bootcamp course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

### PROJECT SCOPE
Given the time and resource limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or representative study of the topic itself, but merely to provide a working environment to support the proogramming and data science portions of the course. 

It could also be used as a source of information to support additional avenues of research in this subject area.
