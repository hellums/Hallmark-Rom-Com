# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repo is a work in progress (not complete). It contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory bootcamp course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

# PROJECT GOALS
This repo and project will have several purposes:
- Satisfy the 4+ minimum requirements of the bootcamp assignment in the syllabus
- Satisfy as many optional requirements as possible

### PROJECT SCOPE
Given the time and resource limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or representative study of the topic itself, but merely to provide a working environment to support the proogramming and data science portions of the course. 

It could also be used as a source of information to support additional avenues of research in this subject area. 
# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
Run "python lacey.py" from the command line in the project folder, using a Python 3 interpreter.

# PACKAGES INVOLVED
See requirements.txt file in project folder.

# FULL SET OF POSSIBLE FEATURES
- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
- Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code.
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
- Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format.
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
- Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams).
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
- Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph).
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
- Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.
- STRETCH FEATURE LIST:
  - These count too! But they will require going outside of the base curriculum to learn about and may be more challenging.
  - Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page.
  - Implement optical character recognition (OCR) that you can upload PDFs to and it will generate the text.
  - Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
