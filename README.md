# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repo is a work in progress (not complete). It contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory bootcamp course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

# PROJECT GOALS
This repo and project will have several purposes:
- Satisfy the 4+ minimum requirements of the bootcamp assignment in the syllabus
- Satisfy as many optional requirements as possible

### PROJECT SCOPE
Given the time and resource limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or representative study of the topic itself, but merely to provide a working environment to support the proogramming and data science portions of the course. 

It could also be used as a source of information to support additional avenues of research in this subject area. 
# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
Run "python romcom.py" from the command line in the project folder, using a Python 3 interpreter.

# PACKAGES INVOLVED
See requirements.txt file in project folder.

# FULL SET OF POSSIBLE FEATURES
Category 1: Python Programming Basics:

- Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.	
- Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code.
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. 
- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format.
- Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams).
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remain until some event).
- Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph).

Category 2: Utilize External Data:
- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.
- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
- Connect to a database and read data using SQL.

Category 3: Data Display
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
- Display data in tabular form

Category 4: Best Practices
- Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
- The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
- Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.

- STRETCH FEATURE LIST:
  - Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page.
  - Implement optical character recognition (OCR) that you can upload PDFs to and it will generate the text.
  - Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
  - Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
