# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repo is a work in progress (not complete). It contains files and related project data for a 12-week introductory bootcamp course (Jan-Apr 2022) on Python programming and data analysis/science in a group learning environment. However, all programming and data analysis is individual, and shared/coordinated with instructors and mentors as necessary.

# PROJECT GOALS
This repo and project will have several purposes:
- Satisfy the 4+ minimum requirements of the bootcamp assignment in the syllabus
- Satisfy as many optional requirements as possible

### PROJECT SCOPE
Given the time and resource limitations, this project is not meant to be an all-inclusive or full programming approach to the _"6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"_ topic itself (using BFS or Breadth-First Search algorithms, for example). It merely provides a working environment to support the proogramming and data science portions of the course, using a subset of movies specific to Hallmark original movies, romantic comedies, mysteries, and dramas.

# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
TO RUN (ON MAC):

python3 romcom.py

TO UNIT TEST (ON MAC):

python3 -m unittest test_romcom
(or python3 -m unittest discover)

ON WINDOWS:

use whichever command launches python 3 (for example, py3 romcom.py, py3 -m unittest test_romcom)

# PACKAGES INVOLVED
See requirements.txt file in project folder.

# FEATURES PLANNED AT PROJECT OUTSET (STRIKETHROUGH = COMPLETED)

- ~~Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.~~
- ~~Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code.~~
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
- ~~Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.~~

Category 2: Utilize External Data:
- ~~Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.~~
- ~~Connect to a database and read data using SQL.~~

Category 3: Data Display
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

Category 4: Best Practices
- The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
- ~~Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.~~

"Stretch" list:

- Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
- Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
